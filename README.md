## EXP 5 : DICTIONARIES IN PYTHON

## THEORY

A dictionary in Python is a collection of data stored in the form of key and value pairs. It is written using curly brackets `{ }`. Each key in a dictionary is unique and is used to access its corresponding value.

Dictionaries are mutable, which means their values can be changed after creation. They are commonly used to store related data such as student details, product prices, usernames and passwords, etc.

Keys are usually strings or numbers, while values can be of any data type. Dictionaries provide fast access to data and make programs simple and efficient.


## 1) Duplicate Keys in Dictionary

1. Start the program
2. Create a dictionary with keys and values
3. Use the same key more than once
4. Print the dictionary
5. Observe that the last value of the duplicate key is stored
6. Stop the program


## 2) Using get() Method

1. Start the program
2. Create a dictionary with names and marks
3. Take a key as input from the user
4. Use the get() method to fetch the value
5. Display the result
6. Stop the program


## 3) Username and Password Check

1. Start the program
2. Create a dictionary with username and password
3. Take username and password from the user
4. Check whether the username exists
5. Compare the entered password with stored password
6. Display login message
7. Stop the program


## 4)Finding Topper

1. Start the program
2. Create a dictionary with student names and marks
3. Find the maximum marks using max()
4. Display the student name and marks
5. Stop the program


## CONCLUSION

In this experiment, we studied Python dictionaries and their operations. We learned how to create dictionaries, handle duplicate keys, retrieve values, use dictionaries for login validation, and find the maximum value. Dictionaries are very useful for handling real-world data in programs.
